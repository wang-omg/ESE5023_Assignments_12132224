## Comment on HW1 Lixc
1-1: d is not define. Maybe you can output an error. (-1p)
3: Interesting methods. (+1p)
5: Good mind flow, but probably loss some iteration within the function to process the whole maze path. And make sure to check whether the output matches your calculations. (-5p)

## Comment on HW2 Lixc (64/100)
1.3 
`apply`, `lambda` and `loc` can be applies for this question. (-5p) 
3.1 
`SID` and `NAME` share the same group. So just find the maximum hurricane within each group and find out the 10 maximum ones. (-3p)
3.2 
If you run `type(df3["WMO_WIND"][1])` , you will find this column is string. You may convert the string to integer before plot. (-3p)
3.4
Recheck plot x and y. (-2p)
3.5 
Better use scatters.
3.6 to 3.10 (-15p)
4 
Please give more data analyses.(-8p)

## Comemnts on HW3 Lixc (49/50)
1.1 
try to use `.plot(col = "month"â€¦)`  to do batch plot 
1.3 
Wrong plot region. (-1p)
2.2 
Either hist graph or line chart is ok.

I shall give you 28/30.
As for the Q1. Please do not use data.plot.scatter directly, try `plt.scatter` from `matplotlib` (-2).

Great job! I shall give you (37/40).
Your report is neat and organized. However, you seem to forget the `observation` part when drawing the graph (-3). Keep going!
